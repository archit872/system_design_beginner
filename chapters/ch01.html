      <h2 id="industry">1.1 What System Design Means in Industry</h2>
      <p>At its core, <strong>system design</strong> is the process of turning requirements into a cohesive architecture under constraints. The constraints include traffic levels, data growth, latency budgets, regulatory obligations, <abbr title="Cloud or on-prem cost to provide a service">cost of goods sold (COGS)</abbr>, team skills, and deadlines. Unlike pure algorithmic problems, the “answer” is rarely unique. Good design is a <em>defensible narrative</em> supported by measurements and trade-offs.</p>
      <p>Industry work usually starts with a problem statement (<em>“We need a notifications service for 50k DAU”</em>) and ends with an implementation plan. Along the way, you’ll analyze <abbr title="Non-functional expectations such as latency, throughput, availability, durability">non-functional requirements</abbr>, choose technologies, sketch data flows, estimate capacity, and propose operational guardrails (rate limits, retries, circuit breakers). It is as much about communication as technology: writing clear design docs and aligning stakeholders is a core competency.</p>
      <div class="callout info">
        <p class="mb-0"><strong>Analogy:</strong> System design is like city planning. Roads (APIs), traffic rules (protocols), buildings (services), utilities (databases, caches), and emergency services (monitoring, on-call) must coordinate. You can expand a city district-by-district if you keep future growth and resilience in mind.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Suppose your company expects a 10× traffic spike during a festival sale. You might pre-warm caches, add auto-scaling rules, and shed non-critical workloads. You’d also cap per-user request rates and prioritize cart/checkout APIs over recommendation refreshes. The design balances <em>reliability</em> under load and <em>maintainability</em> by avoiding ad-hoc hacks.</p>
      <p><strong>Counter-example:</strong> A team chooses a single-node database for a chat product to “avoid complexity.” It works for a pilot but fails under growth; adding sharding later is expensive. Here the design optimized early for simplicity but ignored <em>scalability</em> and <em>availability</em> needs.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="interviews">
      <h2 id="interviews">1.2 System Design in Interviews vs. Practice</h2>
      <p>Interviews compress months of engineering into 30–60 minutes. You won’t build anything; you’ll communicate a clear approach. The signals interviewers look for include: structured requirements gathering, identification of bottlenecks, sane data modeling, awareness of <abbr title="Strategies to reduce or smooth traffic">caching and load leveling</abbr>, and explicit trade-offs. You’ll rarely dive deep into vendor-specific details.</p>
      <p>In practice, you’ll prototype, run load tests, and iterate with metrics. Reliability work (e.g., <abbr title="Service Level Objectives">SLOs</abbr>, <abbr title="Error budgets translate SLOs to allowed failure time">error budgets</abbr>) and operational plans (alerts, dashboards, runbooks) carry heavy weight. Interview designs can be elegant but brittle; production designs must handle failures, migrations, and human error.</p>

    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="goals">
      <h2 id="goals">1.3 Core Goals: Scalability, Reliability, Maintainability</h2>
      <p>These goals provide a compass for decisions. When stuck, ask: <em>Which goal am I optimizing right now, and what am I trading off?</em></p>
      <h3 id="scalability">Scalability</h3>
      <p><strong>Plain:</strong> Will it keep up when usage grows? <strong>Formal:</strong> The property that a system can handle increased load by adding resources, often <abbr title="Increasing the number of machines rather than the power of a single machine">horizontally</abbr>. <strong>Pitfall:</strong> Confusing burst handling with sustained scaling. <strong>Example:</strong> A stateless API behind a load balancer lets you add replicas to increase <abbr title="Requests per second or similar">throughput</abbr>.</p>
      <h3 id="reliability">Reliability</h3>
      <p><strong>Plain:</strong> Does it keep working when things break? <strong>Formal:</strong> The probability a system performs its intended function over a period, often measured via <abbr title="E.g., 99.9% monthly availability">SLA/SLO</abbr>. <strong>Pitfall:</strong> Treating retries as a fix-all; without idempotency and backoff, retries amplify incidents. <strong>Example:</strong> Replication and automated failover keep a service available during a node failure.</p>
      <h3 id="maintainability">Maintainability</h3>
      <p><strong>Plain:</strong> How easily can we change and operate it? <strong>Formal:</strong> The degree of effort required to modify, test, deploy, and troubleshoot. <strong>Pitfall:</strong> Accumulating hidden operational complexity (hand-tuned shards, bespoke queues). <strong>Example:</strong> Well-factored services with clear APIs and dashboards reduce cognitive load for new contributors.</p>
      <div class="callout warn">
        <span class="icon">⚖️</span>
        <strong>Trade-off:</strong> Adding heavy consistency guarantees (e.g., serializable transactions across regions) may improve correctness but increase latency and cost, harming scalability. Choose the weakest consistency that satisfies user needs.

    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="case">
      <h2 id="case">Case Study: “Morning Commute” of a Request (≈200 words)</h2>
      <p>Imagine opening a mobile app to view your notifications. Your client issues an HTTPS request to an API endpoint. A <abbr title="Distributes traffic across servers">load balancer</abbr> selects a healthy replica of the notifications service. Because the service is <strong>stateless</strong>, any replica can serve the request; user state lives in a database and cache. The service queries a <abbr title="Key-value or document store used to speed up reads">cache</abbr> for the user’s unread count (fast path). On a miss, it hits the primary database with an indexed query, then writes the result into the cache with a short TTL.</p>
      <p>To personalize, the service fans out to a “preferences” microservice via RPC. If that dependency is slow, a client-side timeout triggers fallbacks (e.g., default settings) to keep the overall <strong>latency</strong> within the budget. Metrics capture p95 latency and error rates; distributed tracing ties the hop sequence together. If a dependency fails outright, a <abbr title="Stops calls to an unhealthy dependency to prevent cascading failures">circuit breaker</abbr> opens and requests use cached results. The response is returned to the client, and a CDN caches static assets to reduce repeat downloads. In ~200 ms, your inbox appears—an orchestration of scalability (replicas, CDN), reliability (circuit breaker, retries), and maintainability (statelessness, observability).</p>

      <details>
        <summary>1) Define <em>latency</em> in your own words and give a scenario where p95 matters more than average.</summary>
        <div class="pad-2">
          <p><strong>Sample answer:</strong> Latency is the time between sending a request and receiving the response. p95 matters for user experience because a few very slow requests dominate perceived performance—e.g., checkout flows where 1 in 20 users see a spinner for 3 seconds.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Define <em>throughput</em> and explain its tension with latency.</summary>
        <div class="pad-2">
          <p><strong>Sample answer:</strong> Throughput is work completed per unit time. Batching improves throughput but increases per-request latency (e.g., processing 100 messages at once). Conversely, prioritizing low latency may reduce batching opportunities and total throughput.</p>
        </div>

      <details>
        <summary>3) What does <em>scalability</em> mean? Provide a concrete example.</summary>
        <div class="pad-2">
          <p><strong>Sample answer:</strong> The ability to handle increased load by adding resources. Example: A stateless API can scale horizontally by adding pods behind a load balancer.</p>

        <summary>4) How do interviews differ from production design in terms of evidence?</summary>
        <div class="pad-2">
          <p><strong>Sample answer:</strong> Interviews rely on reasoned estimates, while production design requires evidence from benchmarks, staging canaries, load tests, and production metrics.</p>

          <p><strong>Sample answer:</strong> Plain: repeating a request doesn’t double-charge or duplicate effects. Formal: running the same operation multiple times yields an equivalent state. Pitfall: forgetting to include a request identifier so retries create duplicates.</p>
